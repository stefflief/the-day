    <p>Dear Michin</p>
    <p>Hello my love, here's to our first Valentine's day together and many more. You hold space in my heart that no one else could ever feel, you are my favorite place.</p>
    <p>You have made me feel something I never thought possible, you have made me feel a type of love I never thought I deserved. You make me soft, but the good kind and I never want it to stop because without you I will be lost.</p>
